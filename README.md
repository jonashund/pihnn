This project is a continuation of the [PIHNN project](https://github.com/teocala/pihnn) by Matteo Calaf√†.

The extensions are work in progress by Nicolas Cuenca, Jonas Hund, and Tito Andriollo.

TO DO:
- class enriched_PIHNN_devo has to inherit from class DD_PIHNN from the nn module of package pihnn
- How are the tensor shape differences resolved in the newest version where the stresses contain 4 values instead of 10? For now, I reverted everything to what the script said before and it seemingly works.
